Since this class is new to me and I have none done this type of work being able to learn about lighting shapes and texture was something that I advanced all of my skills in OPENGL
I followed a simple process. I broke Down each of the task and then followed through the code step by step with the debugger and overall did not run into many problems.
Down the line in future work just havng these tools at my belt will let me do anything with building. and design. I think if I went down one of those paths I would be prepared

One stratgey that I used alot and is really simple is just trying over and over again with positioning so I could get thing right
Iteration came from running the program over and over again until I got it right alot of closing and re opening the proejct was part of this class
It was really fun to piece all of the parts to one project at the end to have a final completed proejct with everything I learned. So overall I think if I was handed a bigger project I could do it piece by piece.

Computational graphics improve problem-solving by visualizing complex data, essential for fields like game design and simulations.
